# Peudo-Code Tic Tac Toe

Next Week, you'll be building a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game from scratch. To prepare, the deliverable this week is to plan it out! You'll also get to practice writing [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## The Assignment

Fork & Clone this repo. Open this file in your text editor and fill in the sections below. When you're done, make a pull request!

### Part 1: Make a To-Do list

Write out a list of *all* the things you need to do to code this game. This can be as detailed or high-level, though we recommend the former. This is your first time planning an app, so just have fun and just see what you can come up with. There's no right way.

*Write TODO list here*

1. make a 3 by 3 js array that represents the tic tac toe board
2. make a container in my html, which represents the board
    2a. make 9 containers in the container that was made which represent each position in the board.
3. Make CSS for a circle class and a X class which represent the players moves.  Set background img to circle or X. 
4. Make Listeners for all of the containers and if they're clicked make a div within the container that was clicked and then add the div with the appropriate class. 
5. After each move check O has won or X has won.  
    5a. check if the user has a vertical or horizontal win and then check both diagonals if someone wins end game (break loop) and alert user(s) who won
6. If a winner prompt user if they want to play again , if yes clear js board and HTML using DOM.


### Optional Part 2: Pseudo-code your win-logic

Each time a player makes a move, your code will check to see if there is a game-over condition (a win or a draw). Write out this logic in english/psuedocode below. When you're done, anyone should be able to read your pseudo-code and translate it line-by-line into javascript or another language.
